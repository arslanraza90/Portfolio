# [RevBits-ZTN – Zero trust network](https://apps.apple.com/pk/app/revbits-ztn/id1568695445)

This is all about cybersecurity products, the main theme of the App is to provide zero-trust network access to the users. For the Product, we maintain the website and mobile app for iOS and Android as well. Users can handle their own user domain. Initially, when a user registers by using any domain’s email, the first user will be the Admin of its network and after that, all the entries of that particular domain will be considered as users.
Admin can manage their users and also watch their activities as well.
On the mobile side, users will be able to register, log in, and authenticate themselves.

## In the App we covered the following authentications ##
* Face-ID/Touch-ID (Show anyone of them according to device capabilities) OTP
* SMS
* Yubikey
* NFC U2F


Users can authenticate to make themselves an authenticated users of this application. Admin can also Enforce the user to enable some essential authentication types as well.
Push notifications also handle for a better user experience. Like G-mail login notifications, when a user is trying to Login on another device with the same credentials, at that time app receives a notification and asks for approval. If the user allows the web to automatically get a login.
Users also enable authentication by Scanning QR codes through mobile apps and also can do login on the web with scanning as well.
We have integarte postgres, SQLClient, kassandra databases by which user can connect directly with database and run database quires direcly to fetch records and view in mobile app.
